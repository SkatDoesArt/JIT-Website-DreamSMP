# JIT-Website-DreamSMP

A small, personal website project I made when I first started learning to code. This was my total first website, and I was experimenting with HTML and CSS. It’s not perfect and probably has some bugs in it—but that’s kind of the point. I’ve put it here to show people where I started coding.

## Run locally

If you want to look around locally:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) directly in your browser.
   - Optional: use a simple local server (for example, VS Code “Live Server”) for a smoother experience.

## Why this repo exists

I’m keeping this here only to show where I began—what my very first steps in web development looked like. It’s a snapshot of my learning journey.


- Feedback is welcome, but this repo is mainly an archive of my early work.

Thanks for taking a look!
